# Implementation Plan - Port:🌍 (v4)

## 1. Purpose

Define a dependency-aware, parallelizable implementation plan to deliver the v4 PRD in this repository without changing backend ownership.

This plan operationalizes:

- `PRD.md` (requirements and scope)
- `PRD_APPENDIX_INTERFACES.md` (wire contracts and state machines)
- `PRD_ACCEPTANCE.md` (release gate and test matrix)

## 2. Scope and Decision Lock

### Locked decisions for this implementation cycle

- Scope is `MVP v4 Core` only.
- Delivery model is `subsystem workstreams` with explicit dependencies.
- Backend auth for MVP is `none` (no `Authorization` header/token on `/vision/frame`, `/query`, or WebSocket handshake).
- Query start in v4 is manual trigger; automatic wake is deferred to `v4.1+`.

### In scope

- One-click activation flow.
- Manual query trigger compatibility runtime (`wakeword.detected` + `query.started`).
- VAD-based query end detection (`5s` default silence timeout).
- Continuous `POST /vision/frame` at target `1 FPS`.
- Local rolling video and audio buffers.
- Query bundle creation (`WAV + MP4`) and upload to `POST /query`.
- WebSocket control/downlink (`assistant.audio_chunk`) and glasses playback.
- Reconnect/resume behavior and observability.
- Validation against tests `T1-T13`.

### Out of scope

- Backend architecture changes.
- Non-iOS platforms.
- UI polish beyond operational/debug readiness.
- Optional transcript features and advanced UX extras.

## 3. Current Starting Point (Repository)

Already present in this repo:

- DAT registration/callback and camera streaming baseline.
- Photo capture flow from stream sessions.
- Audio collection foundation with HFP-oriented setup and local WAV chunk persistence.
- UI surfaces for registration/stream/audio controls.
- Runtime v4 foundation files are now implemented (`RuntimeConfig`, `RuntimeTypes`, `SessionOrchestrator`, `WakeWordEngine`, `QueryEndpointDetector`, `VisionFrameUploader`, `RollingVideoBuffer`, `QueryBundleBuilder`, `SessionWebSocketClient`, `AssistantPlaybackEngine`, `EventLogger`).

Primary gap to close:

- Move from "feature implemented" to "acceptance-ready":
  - finalize reliability policies (retry/backoff, route recovery, bounded resources),
  - wire lifecycle/background handling to runtime state machine,
  - complete health/telemetry emissions and release evidence,
  - execute and document `T1-T13` pass artifacts.

## 4. External Constraints to Respect

- DAT camera streams are session-state driven and should be handled via observed stream/session transitions.
- DAT stream quality is Bluetooth-bandwidth constrained; requested quality is not guaranteed.
- HFP audio route should be configured before stream/audio workflows that rely on device audio.
- DAT microphone input is 8kHz mono; v4 avoids 16kHz wake-engine assumptions.
- iOS background execution is best-effort and may suspend app runtime; design for resume/reconnect, not uninterrupted guarantees.

## 5. Workstream Breakdown

### WS0 - Contract Confirmation and Runtime Config Baseline

Goal: remove ambiguity before parallel implementation.

Tasks:

1. Confirm endpoint configuration model (`ws`, `/vision/frame`, `/query`) and environment mapping.
2. Confirm event schema fields and error catalog against `PRD_APPENDIX_INTERFACES.md`.
3. Confirm first-pass media parameters:
   - photo target resolution/quality envelope,
   - rolling video context window,
   - WAV sample rate/channel contract for query upload.
4. Record unresolved non-blocking tunables (VAD thresholds, bitrate tuning) in a tracked backlog.

Outputs:

- Confirmed interface contract checklist.
- Runtime configuration matrix for dev/test/prod.

Dependencies: none.

### WS1 - Runtime Orchestrator and State Machine Unification

Goal: establish a single app runtime coordinator that drives all feature streams.

Tasks:

1. Introduce a central session coordinator aligned to PRD states:
   - registration,
   - permissions,
   - session,
   - wake/query,
   - upload/buffer/playback.
2. Replace independent control toggles with one activation/deactivation action.
3. Implement consistent lifecycle hooks for foreground/background transitions.
4. Add deterministic event emission points (ms timestamps, session/query IDs).

Outputs:

- Single activation flow entering stable `active` mode.
- Canonical state transition map used across all streams.

Dependencies: WS0.

### WS2 - Wake and Query Boundary Pipeline

Goal: implement reliable query lifecycle boundaries.

Tasks:

1. Implement manual trigger loop with dedicated runtime ownership and failure handling.
2. Connect manual trigger to `wakeword.detected` compatibility signaling and `query.started`.

4. Add guardrails for duplicate trigger events and overlap suppression.

Outputs:

- Deterministic trigger-to-query lifecycle events.
- Tunable wake/VAD parameters surfaced via config.

Dependencies: WS1, WS0.

Goal: maintain `1 FPS` photo upload during active runtime.

Tasks:

1. Build a frame sampler from DAT stream frames at `1 FPS` effective cadence.
2. Implement JPEG encoding plus base64 payload shaping for `POST /vision/frame`.
3. Add retry/backoff and drop accounting without unbounded queue growth.
4. Instrument cadence, success/failure, and payload size metrics.

Outputs:

- Stable `vision.frame` pipeline with bounded memory behavior.

Dependencies: WS1, WS0.

### WS4 - Rolling Media Buffers

Goal: create query-context media sources locally without continuous upload.

2. Video: implement rolling H.264 buffer with timestamped segment index.
3. Normalize shared clock/timestamp strategy between audio and video tracks.
4. Define buffer eviction policy to cap memory/storage usage.

Outputs:

- Time-addressable rolling audio and video stores.

Dependencies: WS1, WS0.

### WS5 - Query Bundle Builder and Upload

Goal: create and upload self-contained query bundle after endpointing.

Tasks:

1. On `query.ended`, extract:
   - audio interval: query start to query end,
   - video interval: wake-5s to query end.
2. Finalize audio artifact as WAV and video artifact as MP4.
3. Build multipart request (`metadata`, `audio`, `video`) for `POST /query`.
4. Emit `query.bundle.uploaded` with status/bytes/latency.
5. Enforce bundle-time budget and failure categorization.

Outputs:

- End-to-end query bundle pipeline meeting latency targets.

Dependencies: WS2, WS4, WS0.

### WS6 - WebSocket Control and Assistant Audio Playback

Goal: stabilize bidirectional control signaling and downlink audio playback.

Tasks:

1. Implement WebSocket client lifecycle (`connect`, heartbeat, reconnect backoff, protocol validation).
2. Support required message types and sequencing rules.
3. Implement `assistant.audio_chunk` ingest and playback queueing.
4. Guarantee glasses-preferred route handling and route-loss recovery behavior.
5. Support playback control messages (`start_response`, `stop_response`, `cancel_response`).

Outputs:

- Reliable control plane and assistant audio downlink path.

Dependencies: WS1, WS0.

### WS7 - Reliability, Recovery, and Observability Hardening

Tasks:

1. Execute `T1-T13` with artifacts required by `PRD_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
2. Track failures to owning workstreams and close regressions.
3. Produce release evidence pack (logs, metrics, pass/fail checklist).
4. Complete final PRD/appendix/acceptance alignment review.

Outputs:

- Release gate sign-off package.

Dependencies: WS7.

- Skills: app lifecycle, websocket resilience, playback routing.

### Lane 2 - Wake and Audio Intelligence

- Owns: `C`, audio portions of `E`, portions of `F`
- Skills: low-latency audio, manual trigger path, endpointing.

### Lane 3 - Vision and Media Packaging

- Owns: `D`, video portions of `E`, portions of `F`
- Skills: frame pipelines, encoding, timestamped media extraction.

### Lane 4 - QA, Observability, and Reliability

- Owns: `H`, `I`
- Skills: soak testing, metrics validation, failure triage.

## 12. Milestone Checklist (Execution Order)

1. Confirm backend and media contract baseline (`A`).
2. Land unified runtime orchestrator and one-click activation (`B`).
3. Land parallel streams (`C`, `D`, `E`, `G`) with integration stubs.
4. Land query bundle extraction plus multipart upload (`F`).
5. Complete reliability hardening and recovery (`H`).
6. Pass acceptance matrix and compile release evidence (`I`).

## 13. Delivery Definition of Done

All must be true:

- Functional requirements `FR-01` to `FR-13` are demonstrably implemented.
- Non-functional requirements `NFR-01` to `NFR-09` are evidenced by logs/metrics.
- Acceptance matrix `T1-T13` passes with required artifacts.
- No unresolved P0/P1 defects in wake/query/upload/playback/recovery paths.

## 14. Assumptions and Defaults

- Backend auth is not included in MVP.
- Silence timeout default: `5000ms`.
- Pre-wake video context: `5000ms`.
- Photo upload target cadence: `1 FPS`.
- Background continuity is best-effort; resume/reconnect is mandatory after suspension.
- Automatic wake-word detection is out of scope for v4 and tracked for v4.1+.

## 15. Open Questions (Non-Blocking for MVP)

- Final VAD threshold tuning profile for noisy environments. *(RMS threshold and debounce are now configurable via `RuntimeConfig`; environment-specific preset values remain open.)*
- Final video encoding tuning (bitrate, keyframe interval, quality).
- Final retention and deletion policy for uploaded frames and query bundles (backend-side).
- Final battery and CPU threshold budget for extended sessions.
